Description of the project:

The product is a web application that serves as a means to help the user to be
able to locate the nearby national parks. The product allows the user to access
various information about a national park at one stop. The user can locate a
national park in the country and can get the various information about the
particular national park such as weather, things to do, etc. The user can also
mark the visited national park so that itâ€™s in a separate list and can easily
differentiate with the unvisited national parks. Users can also mark the national
park into the bucket list. Lastly the most important, users can also book the
hotels, restaurants, etc. of the nearby national park.
